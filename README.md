## Reflection

Overall, CSS practice sessions were very manageable and quick to finish. However, there were some moments worth taking into account of. Apart from correctly apply css rule and writing a clean syntax. I learn how to think "ergonomically"and try to be precise but flexible. I still need to practice how to avoid causing code abundance and bloating, applying selectors in a smarter way.
