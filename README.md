# Methods for Adding CSS

This is my first practice sessions as part of The Odin Project Curriculum. The purpose of the first session is to learn different methods of adding CSS such as inline, internal and external. 

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing Clean CSS Semantic
- Using relative path to link css file to an html document
- Using <link> tag for an external method of adding css
- Adding inline method of adding a css rule using style attribute in the opening tag
- Adding internal method of adding css to the head section of the html document

## Reflection

I am able to differenciate three methods of adding css. Using a particular method is case specific but generally it is recommended to uses an external method for clean and seamless workflow. Inline method also can be in handy when we want to aply unique styles for specific elements. It is also related to internal method. Otherwise, html doc can become easily bloated and very confusing to manage.
