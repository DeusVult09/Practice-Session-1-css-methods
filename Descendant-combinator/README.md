# Descendant Combinators

## The aim of the given exercise is to apply styles to elements that are descendants of another element.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean CSS syntax
- Correctly apply descendant combinators (space combinators) to write a css rule
- Mixing both type and class selectors as descendant combinators

## Reflection

The exercise was very easy to manage and quick to finish to get the exact result from the desired outcome. The only thing that is worth mentioning is that while it was easy to manage I provided quite limited variations of descendant combinators (e.g "div p" and ".container .text" while there could be more such as "div .tex", or ".container p", etc.)
