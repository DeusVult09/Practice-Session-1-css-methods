# Class and ID selectors practice section

## This is the second practice section in css-intro class dedicated to using id, class and grouping selectors 

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean CSS syntax
- Using relative path to link css file to an html document
- Proper using of id selectors to give unique styles 
- Grouping multiple class selectors
- Combining both class selectors and id selectors within one html element

## Reflection

I am able to use id and class selectors, group or combine them. The assignment part was not difficult to complete and i achieved the desired outcome. However, upon checking the css solution sheet I figured out that the solution sheet had much cleaner and more flexible code writing, e.g one html element had both id and class selectors reducing code writing multiple times. Even though, my way of writing was more straightforward I had the same results. What I did differently was grouping two classes. Next time, I will try to be more flexible in choosing selectors to make my code writing much cleaner and flexible.
