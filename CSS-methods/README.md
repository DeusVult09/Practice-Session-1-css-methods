# Methods for Adding CSS

## This is my first practice session as part of The OdinProject Curriculum. The purpose of the first session is to learn different methods for adding CSS such as inline, internal and external. 

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean CSS syntax
- Using relative path to link css file to an html document
- Using <link> tag for an external method
- Adding inline method using [style] attribute in the opening tag
- Adding internal method to the head section of an html document

## Reflection

I am able to differentiate 3 methods of adding css rule. Using a particular method is case specific but generally it is recommended to use an external method for clean and seamless workflow. Inline method also can be in handy if we want to apply unique styles for specific elements, the same applies to internal method. Otherwise, html doc. can easily become bloated and harder to manage the content.
