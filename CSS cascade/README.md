# CSS Cascade 

## Exercises target at understanding rule order and specificity of CSS cascade

## Skills Demonstrated

- writing clean css code syntax 
- good command of css specificity
- understanding the importance of rule declaration based on position (the latter rule applied takes precedence) and type (inline method is the strongest, followed by internal and external is the least strong)
- using different selectors and combinators while applying a css declaration

## Reflection

This particular exercises was finished without major struggles, even though it took me some time to figure out a proper solution with clean code and avoiding code redundancy. Considering the fact that I could achieve the desired outcome, my code writing had slight differences and I used many possible variations using descendant child combinators.
