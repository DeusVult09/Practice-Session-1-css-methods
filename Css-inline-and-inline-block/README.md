# CSS Box Model. Block and Inline

## This section is dedicated to practical exercises on layout positioning using CSS and the concept of Box Model and the behavior of block-level and inline-level elements.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Applying the CSS Box Model: margin, border, padding, to the content
- Differentiating between block-level and inline-level elements
- Changing element display behavior using the display property
- Inspecting and debugging layout issues using browser developer tools
- Writing clean CSS for layout structure

## Reflection

These exercises helped me to better understand how elements behave on a webpage and how the Box Model affects spacing and layout. I became more comfortable using developer tools to inspect box dimensions and understand why elements appeared as they did.

Key takeaways:
- know when to use block vs inline elements
- how to switch between them using display property. 
- while the the first part of exercises were straightforward amd easy to manage, the second part was very challenging and made me spend some time to position elements using inline, block or inline-blocks as well as correctly apply Box-Model to the content.
